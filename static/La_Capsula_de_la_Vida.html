	<h1>La Capsula de la Vida Mobile App</h1>
	<p>In Tijuana, many adolescents, affected by HIV or AIDS, do not take their medication consistently, which can have life-threatening consequences, such as endangering the body’s viral load levels and boosting the body’s resistance to the medicine. They still skip medication though because of a lack of understanding of the medication’s importance and the desire to avoid the unfavorable side effects of the drug. Sometimes, they just forget. Our partner organization, Es Por Los Niños, was founded by Rosalva Vasquez to support these youth who struggle to keep up with medication adherence, along with other young adults and women affected by HIV/AIDS in Tijuana. </p>
	<p>Rosalva identified a need for an effective way to encourage these adolescents to be consistent with their medication intake, as well as to motivate them to seek a greater understanding of their diagnosis and the medication’s purpose. She explained that a social stigma surrounds the diagnosis, which in turn causes society to rarely speak about HIV/AIDS. Even parents refuse to tell their children about their diagnosis and the purpose of the medication until later in life, leading to the aforementioned gap in understanding. These youth are Spanish-speaking residents of Tijuana who often have smartphones but limited internet access. </p>
	<p>The team, HIV/AIDS Reminder and Knowledge (HARK), worked closely with the children and staff of Es Por Los Niños to develop a phone app that does not require internet access to effectively remind the youth/adolescents and promote education of HIV/AIDS. After defining the problem and the target population, our team generated many ideas for the components of the app and narrowed them down based on viability, practicality and received feedback. Eventually, our main concepts were generated, each with different focuses--social, game incentive, etc. All of which were evaluated with our stakeholders’ feedback, allowing our team to further refine our concepts to a finalized design.</p>
	<p>The final design, La Cápsula de la Vida includes a login page with a logo, proposed by our target users, that will not only ensure their privacy, but also include in our design team. Users can create a profile, and upon login, their profile can show their medication information, viral load estimations and daily motivational phrases to encourage positivity. Different tabs address the underlying needs: HIV Education, Medication Reminder, Game, and Important Information. The Education tab gives simplified, general information on how the medication affects the virus. The Medication Reminder tab allows users to adjust their medication reminders and alarms. The Game tab offers incentives for every time the users take medication, they can earn points to receive streak badges and level-up. Lastly, the Important Information tab can offer additional information on HIV and AIDS. </p>
